<h1>Critique from my client</h1>
The website design project comprehensively uses video, image and text to show the general situation, historical evolution, professional setting and campus environment of our college. The layout of the web page is reasonable, the navigation level is clear, and the goal of the project can be achieved. Although there is a gap with mature commercial web pages in page beautification and color matching, it does not affect its success as a primary work.
